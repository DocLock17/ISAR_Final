        "\n",
        "After managing to make batches acceptable to the TensorFlow's .fit() method, we noticed a massive increase in training speed. The victory was short lived, however, as memory usage skyrocket outside the limits of both colaboratory and one local workstation (128GB). So, both the deque and image pre-processors had to be re-examined. This resulted in a home brewed ring buffer and numpy base preprocessor being implemented, which monumentally increased speed. Implementing the image pre-processor buffer using numpy arrays saved a few extra operations so I am confident this was all we cound do. However, in the final edit we realized that the FrameStack Wrapper from the Baselines package could be instantiated with 3 frame setting rendering this preprocessor no longer necessary and implemented a rotating list ring buffer based on Geron's implementation which provides the random access benefits of our ring buffer that doesn' waste cpu cycles moving indices."

        "As the agent finally blitzed through the code, we are getting close to the deadline and what began as an awesome undertaking in abstraction might formally (and temporarily) become a pure comparision of how the transfer learned weights from notebook 1 affect training speed. However, there is still yet another problem, because with only 9 days left to finish, and each test taking a full 12 hours to see results the results come in and the model is still showing no progress. Luckily, one more day of debugging and preparation found a simple bug causing enourmous amounts of pre-buffer data to be labelled terminal. After this fix, the agent has begun to train comparably to the only other working example we found (linked above). This implementation is still slower, however, in that example the baselines wrapper provided by DeepMind is used, which contains significant speed and memory optimizations which unfortunately, only appear to offer frame stacking at 4 frames. Since this would impair our transfer learning basis this is currently the fastest implementation we can provide."
